It was after midnight on a work night. I was reading Twitter when suddenly I was struck by inspiration. An idea so foolish, nobody else has attempted it. Welcome to my stupidest invention ever - a Twitter bot that runs any shell command you send.

I grew up with BBSes, most of them small, single user systems. Throughout the years, single user systems have come to dominate computers. Everyone is intimately familiar with this type of computing, using their single user systems to pull data from larger systems. The idea of sharing compute resources has always fascinated me. This seemed like an interesting way to explore that space.

Thanks for looking at my project. I have a lot of ideas that I still want to implement, so keep an eye out. I'd love to hear what you think, so feel free to send over any questions or feedback! I'm on Twitter.
