@TelnetBot is a new way to remotely access systems on the Internet. Unlike cryptic mechanisms like OpenSSH, TelnetBot protects your compute sessions with end-to-end https security! All session data is automatically logged on Twitter so any administrative actions can be reviewed at any time.

To use, compose a new message from a public Twitter account to @telnetbot. Newlines are supported.
